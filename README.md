### Description

[Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) connects people passionate about rescue/shelter dogs with places that best provide support for them. Brownee’s World contains a question and answer game to learn more about the adoption process and life of a rescue/shelter dog. Questions are designed for all ages so as to prompt discussion about personal responsibilities when interacting with rescue/shelter dogs as well as dogs in general. 

[Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) has a search feature to look for rescue organizations and animal shelters via any 5 digit ZIP code. You can also view a list of items most shelters and rescue organizations will accept as donations. Most places are (almost) always looking for donations of supplies and/or possible volunteers. Brownee's World is inspired by [Animal Assistance 501c3](http://www.animalassistance.org/) and Brownee the Plain Brown Dog LLC. The search functionality for rescue organizations and shelters is powered by [RescueGroups.org API](https://rescuegroups.org/services/adoptable-pet-data-api/).
