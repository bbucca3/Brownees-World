[Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) connects people passionate about rescue dogs with places that best provide support for rescue dogs. [Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) allows you to engage in a question-based game to learn more about the adoption process and life of a rescue dog, and a dog's life in general. Questions are designed for all ages in a way to prompt discussion about personal responsibilities when interacting with rescue dogs and dogs in general. 

There is a search feature to look for rescue organizations and animal shelters via any US zip code. You can also view a list of items most shelters and rescue organizations will accept as donations. Most places are (almost) always looking for donations of supplies and/or possibe volunteers.
