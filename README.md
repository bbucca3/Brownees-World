### Description

[Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) connects people passionate about rescue dogs with places that best provide support for rescue dogs. [Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) allows you to engage in a question-based game to learn more about the adoption process and life of a rescue dog, and a dog's life in general. Questions are designed for all ages in a way to prompt discussion about personal responsibilities when interacting with rescue dogs and dogs in general. 

There is a search feature to look for rescue organizations and animal shelters via any 5 digit USA ZIP code, if available. You can also view a list of items most shelters and rescue organizations will accept as donations. Most places are (almost) always looking for donations of supplies and/or possible volunteers. Brownee's World was inspired by Animal Assistance 501c3 and Brownee the Plain Brown Dog LLC. The search functionality for rescue organizations and shelters is powered by the RescueGroups.org API.
