### Description

[Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) connects people passionate about rescue/shelter dogs with places that best provide support for them. Brownee’s World allows you to engage in a question and answer game to learn more about the adoption process and life of a rescue/shelter dog. Questions are designed for all ages in a way to prompt discussion about personal responsibilities when interacting with rescue/shelter dogs and dogs in general. 

There is a search feature to look for rescue organizations and animal shelters via any 5 digit USA ZIP code. You can also view a list of items most shelters and rescue organizations will accept as donations. Most places are (almost) always looking for donations of supplies and/or possible volunteers. [Brownee’s World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1143337193) was inspired by Animal Assistance 501c3 and Brownee the Plain Brown Dog LLC. The search functionality for rescue organizations and shelters is powered by the RescueGroups.org API.
